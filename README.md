  ## Description
  ---
  This was an awesome project to learn how different parts of a website can feed each other data. The 11th UNCC web dev homework, it incorporate the robust npm tools of the express  package, as well as 'fs' 'path' 'uuid.' Challenges along the way were trying to fully understand routing and retrieving/responding syntax and options, which in the end I gave up on and just worked from the functional models included for me. While I am pleased with several of the projects I've finished so far, this is the closest I've come to a website I'd be proud to encourage friends to use.

  ## Installation
  ---
  If you go to the heroku instance of the site, you don't need to install at all.

  ## Tests
  ---
  No testing needed.

  ## Usage
  ---
  This is for note-taking in a browser.

  ## Contributing

  Starter code came from Trilogy Education Services, and no other contributions please!
